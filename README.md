# Python-for-cytometry-course

This is meant to be a companion to my "R-for-cytometry-course" repo. It isn't as detailed as I am primarily an R user, though I would be quite happy for someone else to improve on this by making a pull request. The material is basically as much of a mirror of the content of the R course as I can make it.
