    "Python is a general purpose programming language that is also excellent for data analysis. It allows you to analyse and plot virtually any kind of data with complete flexibility. Python has many similarities to the R statistical programming language, but has important syntactical differences. Most people will write python code in an *integrated development environment* (IDE), which is an application that just gives you some additional tools to make programming easier. There are many IDEs you could use for python, but I would suggest either [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and following each's guidance on how to set them up with python.\n",

    "### Naming objects\n",
    "How you name your objects is up to you, but there are some rules and recommendations. Firstly, you cannot start an object name with a number or punctuation character, and you should avoid punctuation characters anywhere in the name, with the exception of underscores (`_`). Object names should be a reminder of what value the object stores, so `elisa_data` is a better name than `x` for the same values. When you want your object to have two words in its name, the most common approaches are to use underscores to separate the words (known as snake case), or to capitalise the first letter of each subsequent word (known as camel case). Which you use is up to you, just remember to be consistent, and that python names are case sensitive. Try the naming options below. Can you predict which will result in an error?"
